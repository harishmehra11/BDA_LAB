HOW TO INSTALL APACHE HADOOP 2.6.0 IN UBUNTU (SINGLE NODE SETUP)

Since we know it’s the time for parallel computation to tackle large amount
of dataset, we will require Apache Hadoop (here the name is derived from
Elephant). As Apache Hadoop is the top most contributed Apache project,
more and more features are implemented as well as more and more bugs are
getting fixed in new coming versions. So, by considering this situation we
need to follow slightly different steps than previous version. Here, I am
trying to covering full fledge Hadoop installation steps for BigData
enthusiasts who wish to install Apache Hadoop on their Ubuntu – Linux
machine.

This blog post teaches how to install Apache Hadoop 2.6 over Ubuntu
machine. (You can follow the same blog post for installation over Ubuntu
server machine). To get started with Apache Hadoop install, I recommend
that you should have knowledge of basic Linux commands which will be
helpful in normal operations while installation task.
